;;; The hairy subject of saving and reloading images, with the
;;; restoration of resources and pointers.  
;;;


;; We define on-* macros that let us define functions that are called
;; at specific times, and in the following order:
;;
;; quit
;;     on-quit
;; 
;; save-application
;;     on-quit
;;     on-save
;; 
;; launch
;;     on-restore
;;     on-load-and-now
;;     on-startup

  "
The *LISP-CLEANUP-FUNCTIONS* variable contains a list of functions of
no arguments on which funcall is run just before Macintosh Common Lisp
exits (via QUIT or SAVE-APPLICATION).  These functions are called just
after the windows are closed.

When saving an application, the functions in *LISP-CLEANUP-FUNCTIONS*
are run, then the functions in *SAVE-EXIT-FUNCTIONS* are run.

The *SAVE-EXIT-FUNCTIONS* variable contains a list of functions to be
called when an image is saved.  These functions should perform any
preparation necessary for the image saving.  The functions are called
in the order in which they appear in the list.

When saving an application, the functions in *LISP-CLEANUP-FUNCTIONS*

Listenerâ€™s read loop).  The functions contained in
*LISP-STARTUP-FUNCTIONS* are run after the functions specified by
